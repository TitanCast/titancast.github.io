                    We're not saying you should cram TitanCast into your application if it doesn't need it
                    - that's pointless. However, you should definitely consider TitanCast if you feel that your
                    application could benefit from an extra display or an alternative way of interacting with it.
                </p>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    We've made it <i>really</i> simple for you to integrate TitanCast into your applications,
                    so you can still continue to devote your attention to <i>your</i> application.
